This is an OpenWrt package feed containing abandoned or broken packages.

To use these packages, add the following line to the feeds.conf
in the OpenWrt buildroot:

  src-git openwrt-abandoned git://github.com/openwrt/packages-abandoned.git

Update the feed:

  ./scripts/feeds update openwrt-abandoned

Activate the packages:

  ./scripts/feeds install -a -p openwrt-abandoned

The extra packages should now appear in menuconfig.
